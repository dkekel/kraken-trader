Coins for Buy low Sell high

Your strategy’s use of **1-hour candles** and **6–10 day moving averages (MAs)** adds critical context. These parameters prioritize short-to-medium-term trend reversals while smoothing out intraday noise. Here’s how my suggestions adapt to your setup:

---

### **1. Key Adjustments for Your Timeframe & MA Period**
- **6–10 day MA on 1h candles** = **144–240 hourly periods** (e.g., 10 days = 240 hours).  
  This timeframe balances reactivity (1h granularity) with trend confirmation (6–10 days smoothing).  
  Focus on assets where:
    - Trends persist for **3–7 days** (aligns with your MA window).
    - Volatility is consistent enough to trigger reversals without excessive whipsaws.
    - Liquidity ensures clean price action on 1h candles (minimize gaps/spikes).

### **2. Best Crypto Pairs for Your Strategy**
#### **A. Large-Caps with Clean Trends**
1. **BTC/USD**
    - Why: Dominant trends on 1h charts, smooth MA crossovers, low noise.
    - MA Pair Example: 144-period (6-day) EMA + 240-period (10-day) SMA.
    - Watch For: Reversals near key BTC levels (e.g., $60K, $50K psychological zones).

2. **ETH/USD** (Already tested)
    - Expand to other chains with similar behavior:
        - **SOL/USD**: Strong uptrends/downtrends on 1h, reacts to Ethereum ETF/news spillover.
        - **BNB/USD**: Less volatile than ETH but follows exchange-driven trends (Binance listings, burn events).

3. **XRP/USD**
    - Consolidates tightly on 1h, then breaks sharply (news-driven). Use MAs to catch post-consolidation reversals.

---

#### **B. Mid-Caps with Predictable Volatility**
1. **LINK/USD**
    - Oracle updates/partnerships create 3–5 day trends. Use 1h candles to catch reversals after pumps/dumps.

2. **AVAX/USD**
    - Strong 1h trends during DeFi/NFT hype cycles. MAs help avoid false breakouts in its choppy range.

3. **MATIC/USD**
    - Reacts to Ethereum L2 news; 1h reversals often align with MA crossovers after 6–10 days of sideways action.

---

#### **C. High-Volatility Coins (Strict Stop-Loss Required)**
1. **DOGE/USD**
    - Retail-driven 1h pumps; use MAs to avoid buying into exhaustion (e.g., MA crossovers after Elon tweets).

2. **PEPE/USD or SHIB/USD**
    - Extreme volatility; pair 1h candles with 6–10 day MAs to filter out noise from meme rallies.

---

### **3. Avoid These Coins**
- **Low-liquidity tokens** (e.g., most small-cap DEX coins): Slippage and erratic 1h candles will break your strategy.
- **Stablecoins or "dead" coins** (e.g., XMR, LTC): Not enough movement for trend reversals.
- **Newly launched tokens**: Insufficient historical data for backtesting 6–10 day MAs.

---

### **4. Strategy Tweaks for 1h + 6–10 Day MAs**
- **Combine MAs with Oscillators**: Add **RSI (14–24)** or **Stochastic (21,3)** to confirm reversals when price crosses the MA.
- **Time-Based Filters**: Avoid trading during low-volume hours (e.g., 12 AM–4 AM UTC) to reduce false signals.
- **Dynamic MA Periods**: Test slight adjustments (e.g., 168-period = 7 days) for coins with weekly cycles (e.g., BNB’s weekly burns).

---

### **5. Backtesting Tips for Your Parameters**
1. **Trend Persistence Check**: Use the **ADX (14)** on 1h charts—focus on coins with ADX > 25 during trends.
2. **Drawdown Analysis**: Ensure stop-losses are tighter than the MA distance (e.g., stop-loss at 2x the 1h ATR).
3. **Correlation with BTC**: If ETH’s 50% win rate is due to BTC dominance, test on low-correlation coins (e.g., ADA, DOT).

---

### **Final Shortlist**
Prioritize:
1. **BTC/USD** (benchmark for trend reliability).
2. **SOL/USD** (high volatility + clean trends).
3. **AVAX/USD** (event-driven reversals within 6–10 days).
4. **LINK/USD** (strong MA crossovers after partnerships).

Test with **DOGE/USD** cautiously for stress-testing your stop-loss logic.
